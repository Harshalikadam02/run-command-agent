# 🪄 Run Command Agent — Your AI-Powered Command Line Wizard

Ever wished you could just **tell** your computer what to do — in plain English — and it magically does it?  
Meet **Run Command Agent**: An AI-powered assistant that turns natural language instructions into real executed commands on your system.

## 🚀 What Can It Do?
- 📝 **Create files & folders** — "Make a folder called reports and a file called summary.txt"
- ✏ **Edit files** — "Add 'Hello World' to my notes.txt file"
- 📂 **List contents** — "Show me all files in my current directory"
- ⚙ **Run scripts** — "Execute my backup.sh script"
- 🌐 **Install packages** — "Install requests library using pip"
EVERYTHING
If your terminal can do it, this agent can make it happen too.

## 🧠 How It Works
This isn't just a static script. It's a **thinking agent** that:
1. Understands your request
2. Plans the steps
3. Executes the right system commands
4. Observes results
5. Explains what it did

Example:
```plaintext
> create a file called magic.txt in my current directory
Plan: The user wants to create a file named magic.txt.
Action: Execute `touch magic.txt`.
Observe: File created successfully.
Output: The file named 'magic.txt' has been successfully created.
